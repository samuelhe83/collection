Listed in order of difficulty (my opinion) from Easiest->Hardest:

Easy.
1. Bubble Sort. -
2. Selection Sort. -
3. Insertion Sort. -

Medium.
4. Merge Sort.
5. Heap Sort.
6. Quick Sort. -

Hard.
7. Bucket Sort.
8. Radix Sort.
9. Counting Sort.

I would highly suggest you go through them in that order, as the later sorts typically use a concept found in one of the easier sorts.
